DeepFlow is a novel flow-based generation framework that enhances velocity representation through inter layer communication using deep supervision and acceleration mechanism.

DeepFlow converges 8 times faster on ImageNet with equivalent performance and further reduces FID by 2.6 while halving training time compared to previous flow based models without a classifier free guidance. 

# News
[2025/05/XX]üî•We release training code, sampling code, and checkpoints of DeepFlow.

# Introduction
DeepFlow incorporates deep supervision by evenly adding velocity prediction within transformer blocks, further enhanced by the
proposed Velocity Alignment block (VeRA).

# Getting started
## Installation
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset
We conducted our experiments using [ImageNet](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/imagenet-object-localization-challenge/data).
Kindly refer to preprocessing guide from [REPA](https://github.com/sihyun-yu/REPA/tree/main/preprocessing) to preprocess the dataset.

## Training
For training DeepFlow-XL/2-3T, use below training script.
```shell
bash script/xlarge/train.sh
```
where you can set following options:
- `--tg-upper-bound`: time-gap between adjacent branches
- `--weighting`: time-step sampling during training
- `--df-idxs`: key transformer layers where deep supervision is applied. (currently, equally-splitted)
- `--ssl-align`: whether to use SSL align (need to set up `--enc-type` as well)
- `--legacy-scaling`: whether to use soft-cap for scaling factor in velocity_modulation (enable this when ssl-align is enabled for reproducibility)

## Generation
For generative samples from DeepFlow-XL/2-3T, use below evaluation script.
```shell
bash script/xlarge/eval.sh
```
where you need to set specific path for checkpoint that will be evaluated.

Please follow [ADM evaluation](https://github.com/openai/guided-diffusion/tree/main/evaluations) for obtaining FID score.



## Model Zoo

We release checkpoint of DeepFlow trained on ImageNet for your reference.
